        "Which dominates?\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Read and Write Bandwidth: Affects the speed at which data is transferred between memory and compute units. Low bandwidth can bottleneck the computation, especially in convolutional layers that require multiple data transfers for feature maps.\n",
        "\n",
        "Latency: Higher memory latency can slow down computation by increasing the time taken to fetch data. This becomes critical when dealing with small datasets or small batch sizes, as the overhead of data transfer can outpace computation.\n",
